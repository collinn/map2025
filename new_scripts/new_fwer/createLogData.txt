description for paper (!!! WORK IN PROGRESS!!!):
To demonstrate the inflated TIE of the homogenous bootstrap method, we 
create two logistic curves from the same distribution. We use a four-
parameter logistic function, so we theta = (p, b, s, x), where p = peak,
b = baseline, s = slope, x = crossover parameters. theta ~ N(mu_g, V_g) 
under the many means assumption. Under the single means assumption,
theta_i = theta_j for all i, j in the group.

Error structure is either autocorrelated or IID.
