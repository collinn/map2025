createPlineData Description:
* Create a matrix of noisy data for the first group. The pre-period slope is
  centered at zero, and the post-period slope is centered at 0.05 (by default)
* If many means is false, then change the noisy data and set all pre-period
  slopes to zero and all post-period slopes to 0.05 (again, these are the 
  default values)
* Make sure all the post-period slopes are positive
* For each row in the matrix, label the appropriate ID and group and add
  errors (either autocorrelated or normal)
* Create a second group, this time with both pre and post slopes centered
  around zero. 
* Create a matrix of noisy data centered around zero (for both columns)
    Note: it might make more sense to just have one column, since we might not
          want group B to have any changes
* If many means is false, set both slopes to zero
* If the groups are paired, we know the IDs should match and the intercept
  should be the same among the two lines (optional)
* For each row in this matrix, label the appropriate ID and group and add 
  errors (either autocorrelated or normal)
