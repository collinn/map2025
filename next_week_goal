# For both

organize results from sims i.e., plot and table R scripts

# power simulation

## what is the point?

make some tables

- description of data generation
    - how many subjects in each group
    - distribution of parameters
    - autocorrelation?
- details of metapars
    - autocorrelation in bdots
    - many/single means, etc, 
 - details of results
    - genearl conclusions
    - comments on power comparisons
    - ???
 - README
 - recreate plots to make them look nicer
 - power plots should use proportion
 
 # fwer
 
 ## what is the point?
 
 which settings are we keeping and why?
    - demonstrate with and without AR for single mean
    - handful for others
