For git repository:

    - Add .gitignore to include rds files
    - Create directory for weekly summary of activities

For scripts:

    - This uses the older version of bdots (i.e., bdotsFit instead of bfit)
    - When going through, you should update code to use new function names and arguments (see ?bfit vs ?bdotsFit, the curveFun argument is an example)
