* Ran simulations without HPC and calculated average TIE, T2E, and power among
  the three different methods
* Analyzed the results from calc_power and compared them to the full rds file
* Communicate with ITS to figure out how to get the HPC running
* Analyze the power files to see if there are issues with data generation, 
  population curve fitting, or power calculations
* Run the simulations with the HPC extracting the entire objects along with 
  sigTime and analyzed the results
* Edit the piecewise data generation
* Begin experimenting with vertical distance instead of horizontal distance
  as measure of power
